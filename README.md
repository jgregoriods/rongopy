## What is rongorongo?
<img src="img/key.png" align="left">
<p>Rongorongo (henceforth RoR) is an undeciphered glyph system from Easter Island. The very nature of RoR as true writing is debated. In the past, the prevalent view was that the glyphs were a mnemonic device and were unrelated to the specific words of the chants they were meant to recall (Métraux 1957; Routledge 1919). Nowadays, most scholars assume that the system was either logographic, with a few phonetic complements (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/jso.1990.2882">Guy 1990,</a> <a href="https://kahualike.manoa.hawaii.edu/rnj/vol20/iss1/9/">2006</a>; <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20706625">Fischer 1995a</a>), or predominantly syllabic, with certain glyphs working as determinatives or logograms (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/jso.1996.1995">Pozdniakov 1996</a>; <a href="http://pozdniakov.free.fr/publications/2007_Rapanui_Writing_and_the_Rapanui_Language.pdf">Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov 2007</a>; <a href="https://kahualike.manoa.hawaii.edu/rnj/vol19/iss2/6/">Horley 2005,</a><a href="https://kahualike.manoa.hawaii.edu/rnj/vol21/iss1/7/"> 2007</a>).</p>
<p>The canonical RoR corpus is comprised of texts carved on 20 wooden tablets, one staff, two <i>reimiro</i> (pectoral adornments), one birdman sculpture (<i>tagata manu</i>), and one snuffbox (assembled from an earlier tablet). A bark-cloth fragment has recently been recognized as another genuine inscription (<a href="ps://www.sav.sk/index.php?lang=sk&doc=journal-list&part=article_response_page&journal_article_no=17609">Schoch and Melka 2019</a>). The texts are repetitive, with three tablets (H, P, Q) containing the same text. Certain sequences of glyphs, some of them quite long, appear in multiple artefacts.<p>
<p>The only RoR passage whose meaning is thought to be understood by most scholars is the lunar calendar on tablet <i>Mamari</i> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/jso.1990.2882">Guy 1990</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.4000/jso.6314">Horley 2011</a>; but see <a href="https://doi.org/10.15286/jps.121.3.243-274">Davletshin 2012</a>). Repeated crescent-shaped glyphs are combined with other signs, presumably phonetic complements used to spell the names of the nights.</p>
<p>The antiquity of the system is another point of contention (<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20706648">Langdon and Fischer 1996</a>). Most of the artefacts appear to be recent. Three tablets were carved on European oars, and the only radiocarbon measurement available (for tablet Q, Small St. Petersburg) points to the 19th century (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1834-4453.2005.tb00597.x">Orliac 2005</a>). If, however, RoR can be proven earlier than the European encounter and its function as real writing can be ascertained, this would be a remarkable finding - one of the rare cases of independent invention of writing in the world.</p>

## Approaches to decipherment
<img src="img/key.png" align="left">
<p>The earliest attempts at decipherment, still in the 19th century, took advantage of the fact that informants were still alive who had presumably been instructed in RoR - or at least heard the tablets being recited (Routledge 1919). Two informants, named Metoro and Ure Vaeiko, provided readings for entire tablets (Thompson 1889; Jaussen 1893). Metoro's readings - apparently just a description of the objects depicted by individual glyphs - formed the basis for Thomas Barthel's interpretation of RoR (Barthel 1958).</p>
<p>Yuri Knorozov, famous for the decipherment of Maya glyphs, was later involved with other Soviet scholars in the study of RoR (Butinov and Knorozov 1957). Their understanding was that RoR was a mixed writing with logograms and phonetic complements, similar to other hieroglyphic systems.</p>
<p>The many publications of Jacques Guy</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Steven R. Fischer brought renewed attention to the field with his purported decipherment. Based on similarities with the structure of a cosmogonic chant recited by Ure Vaeiko, Fischer read a series of procreation triads in the Santiago Staff (<a href="https://kahualike.manoa.hawaii.edu/rnj/vol9/iss4/1/">Fischer 1995a</a>) and other tablets (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20706625">Fischer 1995b</a>). His work, however, was heavily criticized by other RoR scholars (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/jso.1998.2041">Guy 1998</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.3406/jso.1996.1995">Pozdniakov 1996</a>).</p>
<p>The most recent work by Igor Pozdniakov () and Paul Horley () is focused on simplifying Barthel's catalogue by isolating the basic glyphs in RoR and comparing glyph and Rapanui syllable statistics. Albert Davletshin () has attempted to separate syllabograms and logograms in RoR based on glyph combinatorial properties. A very promising approach was also recently pursued by Martyn Harris and Tomi Melka using <i>n</i>-gram collocation and latent semantic analysis (LSA) ().</p>
